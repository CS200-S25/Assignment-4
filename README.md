# Assignment-4

There are three parts for assignment 3:
- [ ] Part 1 - Practice with GUIs
- [ ] Part 2 - Continuing your text-based adventure game

## Part 1: Practice with GUIs
In this part of the PSET, you will practice identifying components of given GUIs and recreate them using JavaFX. 
For the following GUI for a recipe management program:

![alt text](https://github.com/CS200-S25/Assignment-4/blob/main/GUI.jpg?raw=true)

1. Recreate this GUI using controls from JavaFX in a way that closely matches this image visually, you will get full credit if you use a control that closely resembles the element in the image even if it is not the same one.
2. Sketch a scene graph on paper of your resulting GUI (see section 6.1.2 for an example scene graph https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c6/s1.html)

As a resource, it would be helpful to browse through a list of JavaFX controls: https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/ui_controls/jfxpub-ui_controls.htm and a list of JavaFX layouts: https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/layout/builtin_layouts.htm.
