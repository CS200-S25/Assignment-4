There are three parts for assignment 3:
- [ ] Part 1 - Practice with GUIs
- [ ] Part 2 - Continuing your text-based adventure game

## Part 1: Practice with GUIs
In this part of the PSET, you will practice identifying components of given GUIs and recreate them using JavaFX. 
For the following GUI for a recipe management program:
1. Recreate this GUI using controls from JavaFX in a way that closely matches this image visually, you will get full credit if you use a control that closely resembles the element in the image even if it is not the same one.
2. Sketch a scene graph on paper of your resulting GUI (see section 6.1.2 for an example scene graph https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c6/s1.html)
